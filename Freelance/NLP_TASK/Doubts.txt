I know three approaches:
    1. simple python code which can run anywhere preferably in cloudfunctions.
    2. creating a dataflow pipeline.
    3. creating a pyspark code and running it in cloud dataproc.

we need to know more about data. 
    How big is data.
    Is there any preprocessing we need to do.
    Is there any specific output pattern they need.
