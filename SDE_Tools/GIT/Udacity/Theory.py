# Basic Commands
"""
git init        (creates a new git repository)
    => Running the git init command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. 
    => All of these files are stored in a directory called .git (notice the . at the beginning - that means it'll be a hidden directory on Mac/Linux). 
    => This .git directory is the "repo"! This is where git records all of the commits and keeps track of everything!


git clone       (copies the contents of a remote repository to your local machine)
git status      (shows the status of the current directory)
