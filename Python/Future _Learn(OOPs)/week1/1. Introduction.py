# Object Oriented Programming
"""
Object-oriented programming is integral to many programming languages,
and is simply a different style of programming.
"""


# Concepts
"""
=> Learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP)
=> Explore the terms object, class, method, attribute, and instantiation
=> Use objects and classes in Python to create your own programs
=> Create your own objects and classes to build a text-based adventure game
=> Extend existing classes
=> Learn about abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
"""



# What is an Object?
"""
=> Objects are used to model things in code. 
    An object can represent a physical item, such as a display screen; 
    or a digital unit, such as a bank account or an enemy in a computer game.

=> An object is a group of data and functions. 
    Such functions are called methods; 
    they are custom functions specifically designed to interact with an object.
    And because you can define your own objects, you can represent anything you like using an object.

"""

# Where may you have seen objects before?
"""
In Python, everything is an object. 
String and integer variables, lists, and even functions are individual objects. 
While you may not have created your own objects, or been aware of them, 
you will have used objects in your Python programs.

"""


# Why would you want to make an object?
"""
One of the benefits of using object-oriented programming is that,
    unnecessary details can be abstracted away in the implementation of the methods. 
    You do not need to know the specifics of exactly how a method works to be able to use it; 
    you simply need to know that when you call the method, the desired outcome will be achieved.
"""




"""
Attribute: a named piece of data stored within an object

Class: a blueprint for making an object

Instance: a specific example of an object

Method: a function called upon an object allowing interaction with that object

Object: groups together data and functions to model something in code. 
Examples could include a physical item such as an LED, or a digital unit such as a bank account or an enemy in a video game

Object-oriented programming: a different style of programming that brings function and data together
