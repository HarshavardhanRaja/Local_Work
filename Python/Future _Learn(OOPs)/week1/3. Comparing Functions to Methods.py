# Functions:
"""
Functions allow you to give a name to a set of instructions. 
You can pass data to a function, and, optionally, you can have it return some data as a result.
"""


# Methods:
"""
Methods are very similar to functions. 
The difference is that a method is called on an object, 
which means that as well as being able to receive data from outside, 
a method can use all of the data stored inside the object as well.
"""

# Classes:
"""
Python needs a blueprint for the object. 
The blueprint you create for an object is called a class.
