"""
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Mod (the remainder after dividing)
** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
// Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer


The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python.

Variables I
Variables are used all the time in Python! Below is the example you saw in the video where we performed the following:

mv_population = 74728

Here mv_population is a variable, which holds the value of 74728. This assigns the item on the right to the name on the left, which is actually a little different than mathematical equality, as 74728 does not hold the value of mv_population.

In any case, whatever term is on the left side, is now a name for whatever value is on the right side. Once a value has been assigned to a variable name, you can access the value from the variable name.


1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.

2. You can’t use Python's reserved words, or "keywords," as variable names. There are reserved words in every programming language that have important purposes, and you’ll learn about some of these throughout this course. Creating names that are descriptive of the values often will help you avoid using any of these keywords. Here you can see a table of Python's reserved words.

3. The pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.
